Systems design uses computer engineering principles to build large-scale distributed systems. It involves converting business problems and requirements into technical solutions. Senior engineers use system design patterns to make reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.

We mention ten tips/terms used by engineers when designing systems:

Vertical scaling

Preprocessing using cron jobs

Backup servers

Horizontal scaling

Microservices

Distributed Systems

Load Balancing

Decoupling

Logging and metrics calculation

Extensibility
